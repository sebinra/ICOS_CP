# ICOS_CP
prepare and send met files to Carbon portal

This script has been prepared by Christophe Chippeau for the Salles Bilos ICOS site.
It has been generalized by SÃ©bastien Lafont.

The input files are : 

* a datalogger file 
* a header file validated by the ETC
* a correspondance file that link each ETC variable name with the datalogger variable name

The script :
* read the datalogger file
* keep only the last days of the file (to save some computation)
* create a continuous dataset (no time gap) with a timestamp format compliant with ETC
* rename and order the columns according to the ETC header file
* generate daily files (one file per 24 hour period)
* send the last day of the file to the carbon portal
* keep a copy of the file sent to the carbon portal


This script run with Python (and eventually a bash script).
